# Overview

Every year, the World Health Organization estimates that a significant proportion of vaccines arrive at clinics already compromised by cold-chain failures — with no visible sign of damage. The cause: undetected temperature excursions, physical mishandling, and unauthorized access during transit. Current commercial cold-chain monitors cost between $50 and $200 per trip and typically track only a single parameter.

The **Drug Cold-Chain Sentinel** is a compact, self-contained IoT monitoring device built on the MYOSA Mini IoT Kit (ESP32-WROOM-32E). It monitors vaccine and medicine shipments in real time across **6 parameters simultaneously** — temperature, humidity, shock and impact, tamper detection, barometric pressure, and altitude change.

Every alert event is permanently stored as a timestamped JSON log in the device's onboard flash memory (SPIFFS), and a live dashboard is served over a self-hosted Wi-Fi hotspot that any smartphone can access by scanning a QR code on the box — with **zero internet, zero cloud, and zero external infrastructure required**.

The MYOSA platform is uniquely suited to this application. All six sensor boards connect via the MYOSA JST I2C daisy chain — no soldering, no complex wiring — stacked compactly within a standard medicine shipping box. The ESP32's onboard Wi-Fi eliminates the need for any external communication module, enabling the self-hosted QR-code dashboard that makes the system truly zero-infrastructure.

## Key Features

- 6-parameter simultaneous monitoring — temperature, humidity, shock, tamper, pressure, altitude
- Self-hosted Wi-Fi dashboard — board creates its own hotspot at `192.168.4.1`, no internet needed
- QR code access — anyone nearby scans the box and sees the live dashboard instantly on any phone
- Permanent on-device logging — SPIFFS flash memory stores every event even after power off
- OLED real-time display — rotating pages showing status, readings, and network info
- Instant buzzer alarm — local audio alert on any threshold breach
- Digital chain-of-custody passport — exportable JSON log and Python-generated timeline chart
- Zero proprietary infrastructure — no router, no server, no cloud account needed
- Cost-effective — approximately $15 USD total, a fraction of $50–200 commercial alternatives

# Features (Detailed)

## 1. Real-Time Multi-Parameter Cold-Chain Monitoring

Environmental parameters are updated periodically, while critical events such as shock and tamper conditions are monitored continuously in real time.

The AM2302 temperature and humidity sensor monitors the primary cold-chain parameters — alerting whenever temperature exceeds 8°C or drops below 2°C. Humidity is monitored with a maximum threshold of 85%.

All readings update live on both the OLED display and the Wi-Fi dashboard simultaneously, giving both field workers and supervisors immediate visibility into shipment integrity.

</p>

## 2. Shock and Drop Detection

The MPU6050 accelerometer measures acceleration across the X, Y, and Z axes continuously.

The total force magnitude is calculated using:

```plaintext
sqrt(X² + Y² + Z²)
```

When the calculated magnitude exceeds 7 m/s², a `SHOCK_ALERT` is immediately logged with timestamp and force value. This enables detection of drops and rough handling events that could damage sensitive medical products.

## 3. Tamper Detection via Light Sensor

The APDS9960 light sensor faces the inside lid of the shipment box.

Under sealed conditions, the sensor detects near-zero ambient light. If the box is opened during transit, ambient light increases sharply and triggers a `TAMPER_ALERT`.

This creates a permanent tamper-evident digital record of every unauthorized access event throughout the supply chain.

## 4. Altitude and Pressure Monitoring

The BMP180 sensor continuously monitors atmospheric pressure.

Sudden pressure changes greater than 5 hPa between consecutive readings generate a `PRESSURE_ALERT`, indicating possible altitude changes such as aircraft transport or rapid environmental variation.

## 5. Self-Hosted Wi-Fi Dashboard

The ESP32 operates in softAP mode and creates its own Wi-Fi network named:

```plaintext
ColdChainSentinel
```

The onboard web server hosts a dark-themed dashboard at:

```plaintext
http://192.168.4.1
```

The dashboard displays:
- Live sensor readings
- Alert status
- Event history
- Device condition

The page auto-refreshes every 10 seconds.

### Additional API Endpoints

```plaintext
192.168.4.1/data      → live sensor JSON
192.168.4.1/log       → raw event log
192.168.4.1/clearlog  → clear stored log
```

## 6. Permanent On-Device Event Logging (SPIFFS)

All events are stored as JSON entries inside the ESP32 SPIFFS filesystem.

Each entry contains:
- Timestamp
- Event type
- Description
- Sensor value
- Sequential event number

### Example Log Entries

```json
{"t":"00:14:22","e":"TEMP_ALERT","d":"TOO HOT","v":"9.10","n":47}
{"t":"00:16:05","e":"TAMPER_ALERT","d":"BOX OPENED","v":"1.00","n":48}
{"t":"00:18:33","e":"SHOCK_ALERT","d":"IMPACT DETECTED","v":"9.71","n":49}
{"t":"00:22:11","e":"PRESSURE_ALERT","d":"ALTITUDE CHANGE","v":"12.30","n":50}
```

## 7. Python Chain-of-Custody Report Generator

A companion Python script (`generate_chart.py`) downloads the device log and generates a multi-panel analytical report showing:
- Temperature history
- Event timeline
- Shock events
- Alert distribution
- Device summary

The report is generated fully offline without cloud dependency.
