## Overview

SAFEHAT PRO is an ESP32-based smart safety helmet system (MYOSA Mini Kit) designed to enhance worker safety in industrial and confined-space environments. It integrates multiple sensors for real-time hazard detection — including falls, atmospheric pressure anomalies, proximity threats, and emergency signaling — with on-helmet visual feedback via an OLED display.

**What it does:** Continuously monitors a worker's environment and motion to detect falls, confined space entry, nearby hazards, and emergency tap patterns.

**How it works:** An ESP32 reads data from an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope, BMP180 barometric pressure sensor, and APDS9960 proximity/ambient light/gesture sensor. On-board logic evaluates sensor fusion data to identify safety events and displays alerts on an SSD1306 OLED with an audible buzzer alarm.

**Who it is for:** Construction workers, industrial site personnel, confined-space workers, and lone workers who need an extra layer of safety monitoring.

**What problem it solves:** Delayed emergency response in workplace accidents. The system automatically detects falls, monitors for confined-space entry, and enables manual SOS signaling — reducing response time and potentially saving lives.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Fall Detection

The MPU6050 accelerometer continuously measures acceleration magnitude. When the magnitude drops below 0.3 G, a freefall state is flagged. If a subsequent impact spike above 2.5 G is detected, the system transitions to an impact state. After impact, if no significant gyroscope movement is detected for 10 seconds, an unconscious worker alert (SOS) is triggered.

### 2. Confined Space Detection

The BMP180 barometric pressure sensor captures baseline atmospheric pressure at startup. A pressure increase exceeding 1500 Pa combined with ambient light dropping below the configured threshold indicates entry into an underground or confined space. The estimated depth is calculated and displayed on the OLED.

### 3. Morse Tap SOS

The accelerometer detects rapid tap gestures. Three taps within 2 seconds are interpreted as a Morse-code SOS trigger (··· --- ···). This allows a conscious but immobile worker to manually signal for help without needing to reach for a radio or phone.

### 4. Proximity Warning

The APDS9960 proximity sensor continuously scans for nearby objects. When an object approaches within the configured threshold, a warning is displayed on the OLED and logged over serial — alerting the worker to potential collision or intrusion hazards.

### 5. OLED Status Display

The SSD1306 128×64 OLED provides real-time status messages, sensor readings, and alert notifications directly on the helmet, keeping the worker informed without requiring external displays or devices.

## Usage Instructions

1. Power the system using a 5V USB power bank or battery pack connected to the ESP32.
2. On startup, the OLED displays "SAFEHAT PRO" followed by "SYSTEM READY — Monitoring..." once all sensors are initialized.
3. Wear the helmet normally. The system monitors continuously in the background.
4. If a fall occurs, the system automatically detects freefall → impact → potential unconsciousness and triggers an SOS alert on the OLED.
5. To manually trigger an SOS, tap the helmet three times within 2 seconds.
6. The proximity sensor will alert if objects approach too closely.
7. Monitor serial output at 115200 baud for detailed sensor logs and debug information.
