## Overview

**AthletIQ** is a unified smart-belt wearable that delivers real-time biomechanical analysis and adaptive coaching from a single inertial sensor worn at the body's centre of mass.

Commercial fitness trackers report steps and heart rate but cannot judge whether a movement is good or safe. Professional biomechanics labs can, but they rely on force plates and motion-capture systems that cost a fortune and are confined to a room. **AthletIQ bridges this gap** — it extracts clinically meaningful movement metrics from one low-cost sensor in a waist belt, evaluates the quality of each movement on the device itself, and delivers feedback both as an instant haptic buzz on the belt and as an AI coaching review on a dashboard.

Built entirely on the **MYOSA Mini IoT Kit**, the system consolidates all sensing, processing, and feedback into a single compression belt worn at the lower back (sacrum) — the optimal anatomical location for capturing whole-body movement. A front-mounted gesture sensor lets the athlete switch between three coaching modes with a simple hand swipe.

**Who it is for:** grassroots athletes, coaches, physiotherapists, and anyone needing accessible movement analysis without laboratory infrastructure — particularly in resource-constrained settings.

## Problem Statement

Existing movement-analysis solutions force a difficult trade-off. Laboratory systems are accurate but prohibitively expensive, immobile, and inaccessible outside specialised facilities. Consumer wearables are affordable and portable but provide only surface-level metrics, with no capacity to assess movement quality, landing safety, or posture.

Multi-sensor wearable approaches that attempt to bridge this gap often introduce their own problems: distributing sensors across the limbs requires long, fragile wiring that is prone to signal loss and mechanical failure during vigorous activity, complicates donning the device, and reduces real-world usability.

There is a need for a single, robust, low-cost wearable that an athlete can put on in seconds, that captures biomechanically meaningful data reliably during intense movement, and that translates that data into actionable coaching feedback — all without dependence on costly infrastructure or unreliable hardware.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To design a unified, single-sensor smart belt that captures whole-body biomechanical data from the centre of mass

- To measure athletic performance parameters including vertical jump height, flight time, ground-contact time, Reactive Strength Index, and landing impact

- To extend the same sensor to postural and stability assessment for injury prevention and back-health monitoring

- To implement an on-device intelligence layer that evaluates movement quality and delivers real-time haptic feedback

- To provide gesture-based, touchless mode switching suitable for use during physical activity

- To present metrics and an agentic coaching review through an accessible, interactive dashboard

---

## Solution

AthletIQ is implemented on the MYOSA Mini IoT Kit as a single compression waist belt. The MYOSA motherboard, the inertial sensor, and the barometric sensor are housed on the interior of the belt over the sacrum, while the gesture sensor is mounted on the exterior front for touchless control. This consolidated architecture removes the long inter-limb wiring of distributed designs, improving reliability and making the device fast to wear.

The system operates in three coaching modes, selected by a hand gesture over the front of the belt:

- **Jump mode** measures explosive performance — vertical jump height, flight time, ground-contact time, Reactive Strength Index, and peak landing impact — using a flight-time detection method that is more accurate than barometric estimation for fast vertical movement.

- **Plank mode** measures isometric hold time and core stability, tracking trunk deviation from a captured neutral reference and flagging the moment form breaks down.

- **Posture mode** acts as a back-health sentinel, continuously monitoring trunk and pelvic orientation and alerting the user when a slouch is sustained.

All movement evaluation runs locally on the device against biomechanical thresholds, ensuring instant haptic feedback without network dependence. Metrics are streamed wirelessly to an interactive dashboard, where they are visualised in real time and synthesised into a structured coaching review that summarises performance, highlights faults, and tracks trends across a session.

## System Architecture

The architecture is organised around a single sensing node at the centre of mass, an on-belt processing and feedback layer, and an off-belt visualisation and coaching layer.

- **Sensing (on belt):** an inertial sensor at the sacrum captures motion, impact, and orientation; a front-mounted gesture sensor provides touchless mode control; a barometric sensor provides environmental context.
- **Processing (on belt):** the MYOSA motherboard runs the mode-specific biomechanical algorithms and threshold-based fault detection, and drives the haptic feedback.
- **Feedback (on belt):** a vibration motor provides instant, eyes-free alerts for unsafe landings, form breaks, and sustained slouching.
- **Visualisation and coaching (off belt):** metrics are streamed wirelessly to an interactive dashboard that renders live signals, per-mode metric panels, session history, and an agentic coaching review.

## Prototype

### Prototype Design

<img src="/assets/images/AthletIQ/prototype_design.jpg">

The prototype consolidates the MYOSA motherboard, inertial sensor, barometric sensor, actuator, and battery on the rigid rear panel of a compression waist belt, positioned over the sacrum. The gesture sensor is mounted externally on the front closure for touchless mode switching. The rigid panel provides a stable, low-motion mounting surface, and the elastic compression couples the sensor tightly to the body to minimise motion artefacts during dynamic movement.

## Scope of the Project

This project covers single-sensor biomechanical measurement at the centre of mass, multi-mode athletic and postural analysis, on-device movement evaluation with haptic feedback, gesture-based control, and dashboard-based visualisation and coaching within controlled demonstration conditions.

Clinical validation, per-joint angle measurement, large-scale field deployment, and industrial manufacturing considerations are outside the present scope. Distance-derived metrics are reported with appropriate caveats, and the device is presented as a development prototype rather than a finished consumer product.
