## Overview

The **Seizure Detection Device** is a wearable health-monitoring prototype built using the **MYOSA ESP32 platform** and the **MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope**.

The device continuously monitors body movement and detects abnormal seizure-like motion patterns. It also includes fall detection, step counting, gait and activity analysis, local OLED feedback, buzzer alerts, Firebase data storage, and a web dashboard for remote monitoring.

The system is designed as a low-cost prototype for continuous safety and activity monitoring.

> **Important:** This is an educational prototype and is not a clinically validated medical device. It must not be used as a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or emergency care.

## Advancements and Improvements from the Previous Version

The previous version of the project focused mainly on detecting seizure-like movements using acceleration data. The upgraded version includes the following major advancements:

### 1. Fall Detection

A multi-stage fall-detection algorithm was added. It detects the following sequence:

```text
Free fall → impact → post-impact stillness → fall alert
```

When a possible fall is detected, the device activates the buzzer and displays an alert on the OLED screen.

### 2. Gait and Activity Analysis

The upgraded device records movement and acceleration data for basic gait and activity analysis. It now supports:

- Step counting
- Continuous acceleration monitoring
- Walking and movement-pattern visualization
- Session-wise activity recording
- Basic gait analysis using sensor graphs

### 3. Web Dashboard

A Firebase-powered web dashboard was added for remote monitoring and data visualization. The dashboard displays:

- Available monitoring sessions
- Total step count
- Number of recorded sensor data points
- Session duration
- Active session
- Device online/offline status
- Acceleration graphs
- Remote buzzer control
- Remote step-counting control

These upgrades expand the project from a standalone seizure-detection prototype into a broader wearable safety and activity-monitoring system.

### Video Introduction

Our project, developed by **Team Nobita**, is a MYOSA-based Seizure Detection Device designed as a compact wearable system. It uses an ESP32 and MPU6050 sensor to continuously monitor body movement and identify seizure-like motion patterns. The upgraded version also includes fall detection, gait analysis, step counting, and a Firebase-powered web dashboard.

## Features

### 1. Seizure-Like Motion Detection

The MPU6050 continuously measures three-axis acceleration and angular velocity. The firmware calculates the total acceleration magnitude and checks for repeated high-acceleration bursts over a defined time period.

```cpp
float accelerationMagnitude = sqrt(
    ax * ax +
    ay * ay +
    az * az
);
```

A seizure-like motion alert is generated when:

- Acceleration crosses the configured threshold
- Repeated abnormal bursts are detected
- The activity continues for the required duration
- The minimum burst count is reached

When detected, the device activates the buzzer and displays a seizure alert on the OLED.

---

### 2. Fall Detection

Fall detection uses a state-based sequence rather than only one threshold.

```text
Low acceleration
      ↓
High-impact acceleration
      ↓
Post-impact stillness
      ↓
Fall detected
```

This approach helps distinguish an actual fall-like sequence from normal hand movement.

---

### 3. Step Counting and Gait Analysis

The device uses acceleration changes to identify walking steps. Step data and movement signals are stored session-wise and displayed on the dashboard.

The gait-analysis functionality includes:

- Step-count estimation
- Acceleration-pattern recording
- Movement-session comparison
- Graph-based visualization of motion changes

---

### 4. OLED Display and Buzzer Alerts

The OLED displays:

- Current step count
- Current acceleration
- Monitoring status
- Seizure alert
- Fall-detection alert

The buzzer provides immediate local notification during detected events and can also be activated remotely using the dashboard's **Find My** control.

---

### 5. Firebase Data Logging

The ESP32 uploads sensor and step-count data to Firebase Realtime Database.

```text
/
├── initialSessionID
├── StepDetect
├── FindMy
└── DataCollection/
    └── Session_<n>/
        ├── sensorData/
        │   └── <timestamp_ms>: <acceleration_value>
        └── stepCount
```

Each monitoring session is stored separately so previous recordings can be viewed from the dashboard.

---

### 6. Real-Time Web Dashboard

The dashboard uses Firebase and Chart.js to display device data.

It supports:

- Automatic session discovery
- Session selection
- Acceleration graphs
- Step-count display
- Data-point count
- Session-duration calculation
- Active-session display
- Device status
- Remote buzzer control
- Remote step-counting control
