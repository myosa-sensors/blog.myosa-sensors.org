## Overview

Persona is a wearable prototype that continuously monitors motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease and ties that monitoring directly to medication timing.

The device sits on the wrist and reads:
- **Tremor** - via an accelerometer, looking at how sharply acceleration changes moment to moment
- **Muscle activation** - via a surface ECG sensor
- **Whether it's actually being worn** - via a proximity sensor, so readings taken with the device off-wrist aren't mistaken for real data

On a fixed schedule, Persona reminds the wearer to take their medication (OLED display + buzzer), and the wearer confirms or postpones the dose with two physical buttons. When a dose is confirmed, Persona captures a tremor "baseline" at that moment and then tracks the *best* (lowest-tremor) reading over the following window - giving a rough picture of how much the medication improved motor symptoms, and eventually whether that improvement is fading ("wearing-off").

All of this is also exposed live over a self-hosted WiFi dashboard, so a caregiver or clinician can view the same numbers from a phone or laptop without any extra app.

**Key features:**
* Real-time tremor magnitude and EMG activation tracking
* Wear-state detection (proximity sensor) so off-wrist noise isn't recorded as symptom data
* Medication reminders with Confirm / Postpone buttons and buzzer + OLED feedback
* Automatic pre/post-dose tremor comparison to gauge medication response
* Prototype "wearing-off" detection heuristic
* Live WiFi dashboard (HTML) and JSON API, no companion app required

**Who it's for:** People with Parkinson's disease (or their caregivers) who want a simple way to track whether medication timing is actually keeping symptoms under control, and researchers/hobbyists exploring low-cost wearable motor-symptom monitoring.

**What problem it solves:** Parkinson's medication effectiveness often fades between doses ("wearing-off"), but patients and caregivers rarely have objective data on when or how much - they're relying on how the patient *feels*. Persona gives a simple, continuously logged, objective signal (tremor + EMG) tied to the exact moment each dose was taken.

> **Note:** The Motor Performance Index (MPI) score used in this project is a prototype heuristic (60% tremor / 40% EMG, both simple threshold-based formulas) and is **not a clinically validated diagnostic score**. It's intended as a relative, personal tracking signal - not a medical measurement.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Motion & Muscle Sensing
An MPU6050 accelerometer samples motion at ~50 Hz. Tremor magnitude is calculated as the change in acceleration between consecutive fast-loop samples, which better captures the 4-6 Hz frequency range typical of Parkinsonian tremor than a slower sampling rate would. A MyoWare 2.0 EMG sensor is read on the same fast loop, rectified, and smoothed with an exponential moving average to produce a muscle-activation envelope.

### 2. Wear Detection
An APDS9960 proximity sensor checks whether the device is actually against skin. This gates medication-response tracking: if the device is removed mid-tracking, baseline/best-tremor capture is paused rather than recording meaningless noise as real data.

### 3. Medication Reminder & Response Tracking
On a timer, the device enters a "Reminding" state - OLED + buzzer alert the wearer, who presses Confirm or Postpone. Confirming captures a tremor baseline at that instant and starts tracking the best (lowest) tremor reading over the following period, giving a rough before/after picture of the dose's effect. A simple heuristic later flags a possible "wearing-off" event if tremor climbs back up well after the best response was recorded.

### 4. Live Dashboard
The ESP32 hosts its own WiFi access point and a small web server, serving both a human-readable dashboard (auto-refreshing) and a `/data` JSON endpoint for anyone who wants to log or graph the readings externally.

## Usage Instructions

1. Wire the sensors as described in **Requirements / Installation** below, then flash the firmware to the ESP32.
2. On boot, the OLED shows sensor init status and the device connects as a WiFi access point.
3. Connect a phone or laptop to the WiFi network printed on Serial / shown on the OLED.
4. Open the dashboard in a browser at the ESP32's IP address (also printed on Serial) to view live MPI, tremor, EMG, wear status, and medication state.
5. When the buzzer sounds for a medication reminder, press **Confirm** once the dose is taken, or **Postpone** to be reminded again shortly after.

Flashing the firmware (Arduino CLI example):

```plaintext
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32wroom persona
arduino-cli upload -p <PORT> --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32wroom persona
```

Reading live data programmatically:

```python
import requests

data = requests.get("http://<esp32-ip>/data").json()
print(data["mpi"], data["tremor"], data["medState"])
```
