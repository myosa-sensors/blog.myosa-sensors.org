Our team members above along with our team supervisor Engr. Nafissa Maaz have been the driving force behind this project. Each member contributed by working on a use-case for a singular sensor with collaborative effort in combining their functionality for one cohesive project.
## Overview  

MAKE BoTs (Modular Adaptive Knowledge Exchange with Bluetooth of Things) is a modular smart-home and environmental monitoring ecosystem built using the MYOSA platform. The project combines embedded sensor modules, Bluetooth mesh networking, AI-assisted interpretation, and a locally hosted real-time dashboard to create an affordable, privacy-focused smart environment solution.

The system uses distributed sensor nodes powered by ESP32-based hardware and MYOSA-compatible sensors to collect environmental data such as temperature, pressure, motion, light intensity, and gesture information. This data is processed locally and displayed through an interactive web dashboard, reducing dependency on cloud-based services while improving privacy and responsiveness.

## Usage Instructions  


To run the webserver for the project, python v3.12 must be installed on a local network machine and the following scripts need to be run. 

```plaintext

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

```plaintext

python app.py

```

The webserver will be deployed on localhost (127.0.0.1) and can be accessed by any device on the local network through the local IP of the webserver.

For prototype functionality, all the sensors must be connected to the ESP32 or multiple ESP32s which will post the data to localhost endpoints. For testing we used an Arduino and Raspberry Pi 5 as we only received one ESP32 in the kit. The temperature sensor was connected to the Arduino and the Accelerometer and Gyroscope was connected to the Raspberry Pi 5.
