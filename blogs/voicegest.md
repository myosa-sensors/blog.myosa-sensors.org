## Overview

Communication is a basic human right — yet an estimated 70 million non-verbal people worldwide, living with ALS, cerebral palsy, autism, and stroke-related aphasia, are denied it every day. Existing AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) devices cost upwards of ₹6,00,000 and demand fine motor precision that many users no longer have, placing them entirely out of reach for the vast majority of patients in low- and middle-income countries.

**VoiceGest** is a compact, portable communication device built on the MYOSA Mini IoT Kit (ESP32-based) that converts simple, deliberate movements — a hand tilt, a swipe, a breath, a colour card — into spoken phrases in real time. It needs no internet, no app subscription, and no surgical implant — just whatever voluntary movement a user has left.

VoiceGest reads gesture, motion, and breath through the MYOSA MPU6050, APDS9960, and BMP180 sensor boards, fuses the data on-device on the ESP32, and speaks the result aloud through a paired phone via Bluetooth. Every phrase is confirmed on an OLED display before being spoken, giving the user a chance to cancel a misread gesture, and every communication event can optionally be logged with a timestamp to a self-hosted caregiver dashboard.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-modal gesture-to-speech — tilt, rotation, swipe, colour card, and breath all map to spoken phrases
- 20-phrase vocabulary library stored entirely on-device in ESP32 flash memory
- Proximity-gated intent detection — filters out accidental tremors, only classifies deliberate gestures
- On-screen phrase confirmation via OLED before speaking, with a 1-second hold-to-confirm / move-to-cancel gesture
- Bluetooth speech output — works with any free Bluetooth terminal / text-to-speech app, no custom app required
- Optional Wi-Fi caregiver dashboard with live, timestamped, exportable communication log
- Fully offline operation — zero internet, zero cloud dependency, zero recurring cost
- Roughly a fraction of the cost of commercial AAC devices, built entirely on the MYOSA sensor stack

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Tilt-Based Basic Needs (MPU6050 — Accelerometer)

The MPU6050 accelerometer continuously reads tilt direction along the X, Y, and Z axes of the enclosure. Four tilt directions are mapped to core needs:

- Forward → "I need help"
- Backward → "I am hungry"
- Left → "I am in pain"
- Right → "I need water"

This lets a user resting the device on a lap or wheelchair tray communicate a basic need with a single deliberate motion.

### 2. Rotation and Double-Tap Dialogue (MPU6050 — Gyroscope)

The gyroscope on the same MPU6050 board detects rotation and double-tap patterns, enabling quick YES/NO-style dialogue:

- Clockwise rotation → "NO"
- Anti-clockwise rotation → "Thank you"
- Double-tap pattern → "EMERGENCY" (triggers continuous buzzer and a loud spoken alert)

### 3. Hand Swipe Gestures (APDS9960 — Gesture Sensor)

The APDS9960 gesture engine detects directional hand swipes above the device:

- UP → "Call my doctor"
- DOWN → "I want to go home"
- LEFT → "I feel good"
- RIGHT → "I need medicine"

### 4. Proximity-Gated Intent Detection (APDS9960 — Proximity Sensor)

The same APDS9960 board doubles as an intent gate: a gesture is only classified when a hand is within a deliberate interaction range (<10 cm). This filters out accidental tremors or involuntary movements — a critical safeguard for users with limited motor control — and means a single sensor performs both gesture recognition and false-trigger rejection.

### 5. Colour Card Vocabulary (APDS9960 — RGB Sensor)

The same sensor's RGB channel identifies colour cards held near the enclosure, giving users who cannot move the device itself a third, independent input channel:

- RED → "Emergency"
- GREEN → "I feel okay"
- BLUE → "I want to rest"
- YELLOW → "I am happy"

### 6. Breath-Triggered Politeness Prefix (BMP180 — Barometric Pressure)

The BMP180 detects an intentional controlled breath near the enclosure's vent as a pressure spike (delta > 50 Pa). When detected, it prepends "PLEASE" to whatever phrase follows — e.g. "PLEASE, I need help" — giving even users with only breath control an independent communication channel.

### 7. On-Screen Confirmation (SSD1306 OLED)

Every classified phrase is shown on the OLED before it is spoken. The user confirms by holding still for one second, or cancels by moving — preventing misread gestures from being spoken aloud.

### 8. Audio Feedback (Buzzer)

A single beep confirms a gesture was registered and spoken; a double beep signals a misread gesture that needs to be retried. This gives non-visual confirmation for users with visual impairment.

### 9. Bluetooth Speech Output

The confirmed phrase is sent as text via Bluetooth Serial to a paired phone. No custom app is required — any free Bluetooth terminal app configured to read incoming text aloud (using the phone's built-in Text-to-Speech engine) will speak the phrase.

### 10. Optional Wi-Fi Caregiver Dashboard

The ESP32 can simultaneously host a lightweight self-contained web dashboard over Wi-Fi, showing a live, timestamped communication log accessible from any phone or laptop browser and exportable to CSV — while Bluetooth handles real-time speech output. Both wireless channels run concurrently from the same board.

## Experimental Results

VoiceGest was tested through a series of simulated non-verbal communication scenarios, including:

- Tilt-based basic-need signalling in all four directions
- Rotation-based YES/NO dialogue and double-tap emergency triggering
- Directional hand swipe recognition at varying distances
- Colour card recognition under different lighting conditions
- Breath-detection sensitivity and false-positive filtering
- Extended continuous operation on battery power

**Results:**

- Gesture classification completed reliably within 200 ms of a deliberate movement
- Proximity gating successfully filtered out incidental hand movement and tremor-like motion
- OLED confirm/cancel step prevented misread gestures from being spoken
- Stable Bluetooth Serial connection to phone with no noticeable speech delay
- 8+ hours of continuous operation on a single 1000 mAh LiPo charge
- (If enabled) stable concurrent Wi-Fi dashboard operation alongside Bluetooth speech output

## Usage Instructions

```
Step 1: Connect JST sensor chain
Motherboard → OLED → MPU6050 → APDS9960 → BMP180

Step 2: Power on device
Use the onboard 3.7V LiPo battery (charged via the TP4056 module) or a 5V USB power bank

Step 3: Pair with phone
Open a Bluetooth terminal app on your phone, pair with the device, and enable
"read incoming text aloud" / text-to-speech mode

Step 4: Interact
Tilt, rotate, swipe, show a colour card, or blow gently near the vent —
whichever gesture matches your current voluntary movement ability

Step 5: Confirm or cancel
Hold still for 1 second to confirm and speak the phrase, or move to cancel
a misread gesture

Step 6 (optional): Caregiver dashboard
Connect to the device's Wi-Fi hotspot and open the dashboard in a browser
to review the live, timestamped communication log
```
