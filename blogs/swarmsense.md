## Overview

MYOSA SwarmSense Lite is an IoT-based disaster rescue system designed to detect human presence in emergency situations.  
The project uses ESP32 along with multiple sensors to monitor environmental conditions and provide alerts through OLED display, buzzer, LEDs, and Blynk IoT platform.

**Key Features:**

* Human presence detection
* OLED live status monitoring
* Blynk mobile monitoring
* Alert system using buzzer and LEDs
* Multi-sensor environmental monitoring

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Environmental Monitoring

The system continuously monitors environmental conditions using multiple sensors connected to ESP32.

### 2. Human Presence Detection

Motion and environmental data are analyzed to identify possible human presence during disaster situations.

### 3. OLED Status Display

Real-time sensor values and alerts are displayed on the OLED screen.

### 4. IoT Monitoring using Blynk

Sensor data can be monitored remotely through the Blynk mobile application.

### 5. Alert System

When abnormal conditions are detected, LEDs glow and buzzer alerts are activated.
