## Overview

### The Silent Crisis in Neonatal Care

Every year, millions of premature infants are born into resource-constrained environments. In these critical first weeks of life, a stable, sterile environment is not a luxury—it is the difference between life and death. 

Traditional commercial incubators cost upwards of **₹1,50,000 to ₹7,00,000** (₹1.5–7 Lakhs equivalent in local clinical contexts), making them inaccessible to thousands of rural clinics and developing healthcare centers. Furthermore, the physical interaction required to operate standard medical equipment constantly introduces the risk of cross-contamination—a leading cause of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

### Enter Neo-Sentry 1.0

Neo-Sentry is an uncompromising leap forward in frugal medical engineering. We have reimagined the neonatal incubator not as a piece of static hardware, but as an **intelligent, responsive ecosystem**. 

By leveraging the computational power of the ESP32 microarchitecture, advanced optical proximity sensing, and cloud-native telemetry, Neo-Sentry provides **real-time atmospheric stabilization** and **aseptic, touchless control**.

The financial paradigm shift? **₹2,630.**
Technology built to protect premature lives, democratized for the world.

## Features (Detailed)

Neo-Sentry is engineered around four core pillars of survival: **Asepsis, Stability, Awareness, and Affordability.**

### **1. Live Wi-Fi Connectivity**

Neo-Sentry establishes a continuous, stable wireless connection to facility networks with optimized low-RF transmission profiles. The ESP32 connects to hospital Wi-Fi infrastructure while maintaining persistent connectivity for real-time data streaming and remote monitoring.

### **2. Live OLED Telemetry & Monitoring**

The onboard OLED display continuously visualizes:
- Real-time temperature readings
- Patient stillness tracking
- Active alarm states
- System connectivity status

This provides instant bedside feedback without requiring external monitoring devices.

### **3. Automated Climate Hardware Switching**

Neo-Sentry dynamically activates:
- A cooling fan
- A heating LED

whenever incubator temperatures breach configured clinical boundaries.

The automation system maintains environmental stability using threshold-based control logic to ensure safe neonatal thermal conditions.

### **4. Progressive Hardware Buzzer Alarm**

If patient stillness exceeds a 14-second threshold, Neo-Sentry triggers a progressive physical buzzer alarm pulsing at 400ms intervals.

This acts as an immediate bedside fail-safe alert mechanism independent of internet connectivity.

### **5. Aseptic Optical Alarm Suppression**

Medical staff can instantly suppress active alarms without physical contact by casting a flashlight beam over the optical sensor.

This touchless interaction minimizes contamination risk inside sterile neonatal environments.

### **6. Real-Time Telegram Bot Dispatches**

Neo-Sentry broadcasts:
- Temperature anomalies
- Stillness tracking alerts
- Alarm state transitions
- System status notifications

directly to healthcare staff through Telegram bot integration for remote monitoring access.

### **7. Live Cloud Graphing via ThingSpeak**

Environmental telemetry is streamed to ThingSpeak every 20 seconds across multiple live cloud fields, enabling:
- Continuous monitoring
- Historical trend analysis
- Remote visualization dashboards
- Browser-accessible environmental analytics

### **8. Automated Google Sheets Logging**

All sensor telemetry is automatically appended into cloud-hosted Google Sheets with synchronized timestamps, generating a continuously updating historical monitoring database.

### **9. Self-Hosted Offline Fallback Network**

For facilities without internet infrastructure, Neo-Sentry provisions a standalone local Wi-Fi hotspot (`192.168.4.1`) featuring:
- Live telemetry
- Interactive graphs
- Real-time alerts
- Local monitoring dashboards

This ensures uninterrupted operation even during internet outages.

### **10. On-Demand Local Python Reporting Engine**

Neo-Sentry includes a standalone Python analytics engine capable of reading exported telemetry `.csv` files and automatically generating publication-ready clinical trend reports using `matplotlib`.

## Usage Instructions

Deploying Neo-Sentry in a clinical environment is designed to be simple, modular, and adaptable to both connected and offline healthcare infrastructures.

### General System Initialization

1. Connect the main ESP32 control unit to power.
2. The system automatically initializes:
   - OLED telemetry display
   - Environmental sensors
   - Motion monitoring systems
   - Alarm modules
3. Once initialization completes, the OLED dashboard begins displaying live telemetry.
4. The system continuously monitors:
   - Temperature conditions
   - Patient stillness duration
   - Alarm states
   - Hardware switching conditions

If abnormal conditions are detected:
- The buzzer alarm activates
- Cooling fan or heating LED responds automatically
- Remote alerts are dispatched when network services are available

---

## Online Mode (Hospital Wi-Fi Available)

When Wi-Fi infrastructure is available, Neo-Sentry enables full cloud-connected telemetry.

### Features Available in Online Mode

- Telegram Bot Alerts
- ThingSpeak Cloud Graphing

## Future Roadmap

Neo-Sentry 1.0 is just the beginning. Our vision for the next iteration includes:

- **AI-Driven Predictive Analytics:** Implementing TinyML on the edge to analyze micro-fluctuations in temperature and respiration, predicting potential distress events *before* they trigger standard thresholds.
- **Battery Backup Ecosystem:** Integration of seamless Li-ion failover systems to ensure uninterrupted operation during grid power failures common in rural areas.
- **Centralized Hospital Dashboard:** A local web server running on a Raspberry Pi to aggregate data from dozens of Neo-Sentry units across an entire ward into a single React-based UI.

---

## Conclusion

We believe that cutting-edge healthcare technology shouldn't be confined to elite institutions. Neo-Sentry proves that with thoughtful engineering, open-source principles, and a relentless focus on solving real human problems, we can build a future where every premature infant has a fighting chance. 

**This is touchless intelligence. This is affordable critical care.**
