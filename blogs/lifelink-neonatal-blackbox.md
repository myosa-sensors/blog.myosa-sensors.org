## Overview

LifeLink is an intelligent neonatal and infant transport monitoring system designed to improve safety during critical medical transportation. The system focuses on monitoring Environmental Determinants of Health (EDOH) such as vibration trauma, pressure shifts, and unsafe environmental conditions that may negatively affect newborn infants during transport.

The project uses the ESP32 MYOSA motherboard along with multiple sensors to generate real-time safety analytics and alerts for clinicians and transport staff.

### Key Features

* Real-time vibration and motion monitoring
* Pressure and environmental analysis
* Touchless gesture-based interaction
* OLED safety score display
* Emergency buzzer alert system
* Wireless transport data logging
* Smart safety score algorithm
* Web dashboard monitoring system

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Vibration Trauma Detection

The MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor continuously monitors vibration and road stress during neonatal transport. High G-force vibrations caused by potholes or unstable movement trigger emergency alerts.

### 2. Pressure Monitoring

The BMP180 sensor monitors environmental pressure changes during transport. Rapid pressure drops may affect infant respiratory stability and trigger warning conditions.

### 3. Touchless Sterile Interface

The APDS9960 gesture sensor allows healthcare staff to interact with the system without physical contact, helping maintain sterile medical conditions.

### 4. Real-Time Safety Score

The ESP32 processes sensor data using a weighted sensor fusion algorithm and generates a real-time safety score displayed on the OLED screen.

### 5. Emergency Alert System

When unsafe environmental conditions are detected, the buzzer immediately alerts the medical staff for rapid intervention.

### 6. Wireless Data Handover

The ESP32 transmits transport logs and monitoring data wirelessly for clinical review and hospital handover.

### 7. Web Dashboard

A React + Vite based dashboard displays transport history, vibration analysis, environmental conditions, and safety monitoring data in real time.
