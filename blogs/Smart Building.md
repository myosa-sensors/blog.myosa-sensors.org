Introduction

The MYOSA Smart Building Monitoring and Safety System is an IoT-based real-time structural monitoring solution developed using ESP32 and multiple smart sensors. The project is designed to improve building safety by continuously monitoring environmental conditions, vibration intensity, structural tilt, light levels, and emergency situations using embedded electronics and cloud connectivity.

The system combines local monitoring through an OLED display and remote monitoring through the Blynk IoT platform, providing real-time alerts and live data visualization.

Problem Statement

Modern buildings and infrastructures are vulnerable to environmental changes, abnormal vibrations, structural movement, and safety risks. Traditional monitoring systems are often expensive and inaccessible for small-scale applications.

This project aims to develop a compact, affordable, and efficient smart monitoring system capable of detecting abnormal structural conditions and providing real-time alerts using IoT technology.

## How It Works

The ESP32 collects data from MPU6050, BMP180, and APDS9960 sensors. 
The OLED displays live monitoring values while the Blynk IoT platform provides remote visualization and alerts. 
The buzzer activates during abnormal tilt or vibration conditions.

Components Used

Component	    Purpose

.ESP32	       Main microcontroller and WiFi communication

.MPU6050	   Tilt, vibration, and earthquake detection

.BMP180	       Temperature and pressure monitoring

.APDS9960	   Ambient light sensing

.OLED Display  Local real-time monitoring

.Buzzer	       Emergency alert indication

Working Principle

The ESP32 microcontroller continuously collects data from all connected sensors through the I2C communication protocol. The MPU6050 sensor monitors structural movement, tilt angle, and vibration intensity for earthquake and instability detection. The BMP180 sensor measures atmospheric pressure and environmental temperature conditions in real time. The APDS9960 sensor monitors ambient light intensity.

All sensor readings are displayed locally through the OLED display and simultaneously transmitted to the Blynk cloud platform using WiFi connectivity. During abnormal conditions such as excessive vibration, earthquake-like movement, or wall break situations, the system activates emergency alerts through the OLED display and buzzer notification system.
