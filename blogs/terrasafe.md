## Overview
The ESP32 9-DOF Breadcrumb Trail Navigator is a hardware and software solution that allows users to navigate and track their movements without relying on GPS signals. 

* **What the project does:** It records a user's path using dead-reckoning and provides a targeted, visual UI to guide them backward, step-by-step, to their origin. It also hosts an interactive web dashboard for live telemetry.
* **How it works:** It utilizes a 9-DOF sensor array (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) paired with a barometer. Raw data is processed through complementary and Kalman filters for stable heading, while autocorrelation algorithms detect walking steps to map X/Y/Z coordinates.
* **Who it is for:** Hikers, cave explorers, and rescue personnel operating in environments where GPS signals are weak, jammed, or non-existent.
* **What problem it solves:** Standard GPS devices fail underground, deep inside concrete structures, or in dense canopies. This system solves the problem of getting lost in these environments by relying entirely on local, self-contained sensor fusion for return navigation.

## Features (Detailed)

### **1. 9-DOF Sensor Fusion & Kalman Filtering**
Combines the MPU6050 (Accel/Gyro) and QMC5883L (Magnetometer). Raw coordinates calculated from step distance and heading are passed through discrete Kalman filters (`kalman_x`, `kalman_y`) to smooth out jitter, sensor noise, and provide tilt-compensated orientation (Pitch, Roll, Yaw).

### **2. Robust Autocorrelation Pedometer**
Instead of simple peak-detection, accelerometer data is stored in a ring buffer and evaluated using autocorrelation. This determines true human walking cadence, actively filtering out false movements like vehicle bumps or hand waving.

### **3. Vertical Tracking System**
Integrates a BMP180 barometer to track absolute altitude and relative depth/height. It automatically estimates building floor levels or cave depths, though it remains sensitive to long-term weather-induced pressure changes.

### **4. Breadcrumb Reverse Navigation & Waypoints**
Automatically records the user's path. Drop categorized waypoints (Camp, Water, Danger) and receive proximity alerts. With a single button click, the system provides a visual UI to guide you backward to your starting point.

### **5. Embedded Web Server & SOS Beacon**
Hosts a responsive HTML/JS/CSS dashboard directly on the ESP32 (no SD card required). It provides live telemetry, interactive canvas mapping, vertical tracking charts, and allows remote triggering of an emergency SOS visual beacon.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Startup Calibration (Mandatory)
When powered on, the device enters a mandatory calibration phase to ensure dead-reckoning accuracy.
* **Gyroscope Calibration:** Keep the device perfectly still on a flat surface.
* **Compass Calibration:** Follow the on-screen prompts (Figure-8 motions, vertical rotations, and tilts) for 15 seconds.

### 2. Physical Interface (The Button)
The push button (GPIO 16) controls the core navigation states:
* **Single Click:** Toggles between Forward Mode (recording path) and Reverse Mode (following breadcrumbs back to start).
* **Double Click:** Activates the 3D Dashboard on the OLED.

### 3. The Web Interface
1. Connect your phone or laptop to the Wi-Fi network: **`myosa`** (No password by default).
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`.

## Tech Stack
* **Microcontroller:** ESP32 Development Board
* **Sensors:** MPU6050 (IMU), QMC5883L (Magnetometer), BMP180 (Barometer)
* **Display:** 0.96" I2C OLED (SSD1306, 128x64)
* **Software:** Arduino Framework, C++, HTML/CSS/JS (Web Server)

## Requirements / Installation

### Hardware Wiring
All sensors share the primary I2C bus (3.3V Logic).
* **I2C SDA:** GPIO 21
* **I2C SCL:** GPIO 22
* **Reverse Button:** GPIO 16 (Connect to GND, uses internal pull-up)

### Software Setup
1. Clone the repository and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Update the `MAGNETIC_DECLINATION` in the code for your specific geographic location (currently `-0.72` for Thrissur).
3. Install the following dependencies via the Arduino Library Manager:
