Title: KhetGPT — AI-Powered Daily Agricultural Advisory System
 
Excerpt: A MYOSA Mini field node that reads all onboard sensors, pipes the data to a cloud server, calls a Gemini LLM, and delivers a personalised daily farm advisory to the farmer on Telegram — automatically, every day.

## Overview
 
Smallholder farmers make daily decisions — when to irrigate, when to spray, when to harvest with no real-time, hyper-local data. National weather forecasts work at the district scale, not the field scale. Extension bulletins arrive weekly, not daily. There is no personalised, affordable advisory system built for the individual farm.
 
**KhetGPT** solves this by turning the MYOSA Mini into an always-on field intelligence node.  It reads temperature, barometric pressure, ambient light, and canopy colour from the BMP180, MPU6050 and APDS9960 sensors. That data is posted securely to a cloud server, which enriches it with a live weather forecast and hands the combined context to Google Gemini. The LLM generates a plain-language farm advisory — under 500 words — and delivers it to the farmer's messenger service (SMS, WhatsApp,Telegram) automatically.The current implementation uses Telegram for message delivery


No dashboard to check. No app to install. No technical knowledge needed. Just a message every morning in the farmer's own language telling them what happened in their field overnight and what to do today.

**Key features:**
 
* All MYOSA Mini sensors are active and contributing to the advisory
* Gemini LLM generates crop-aware, field-specific advice — not generic tips
* Delivery via Telegram bot — works on any smartphone, no extra app
* Secure ESP-to-server communication with API key authentication and rate limiting
* Fully automated — farmer receives the advisory without touching any device
* Language-configurable — Supports All languages as per the farmers need

## Features (Detailed)
### **1. Sensor data collection**
The MYOSA Mini's BMP180 and APDS9960 are both actively read every loop cycle:
 
| Sensor | Parameter | Agricultural meaning |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| BMP180 | Temperature (°C) | Canopy-level air temp : frost and heat stress detection |
| BMP180 | Barometric pressure (hPa) | Pressure drop = incoming cold front or storm |
| APDS9960 | Ambient light — clear channel (lux) | Photoperiod tracking; day-length affects flowering |
|MPU6050| Animal Intrusion | Equipped in Farming Fences |
 
All four values are packed into a structured plain-English string and posted to the server every 12 hours
### **2. Secure ESP-to-server communication**
 
The ESP32 posts sensor data to the Render-hosted Node.js server over HTTPS with two layers of protection:
 
* **API key header** (`X-ESP-Key`) — every request must carry the correct pre-shared key, verified using `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks
* **Per-IP rate limiting** — maximum 20 requests per 2-minute window per IP; excess requests receive HTTP 429

*The server rejects all unauthorised requests before they reach the LLM, keeping API costs predictable.
 ### **3. Gemini LLM advisory generation**
 
The sensor string is passed directly to `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` via the `@google/genai` SDK. The prompt instructs Gemini to act as a farm advisor and generate a report in the farmer's configured language, under 500 words. The model reasons across all sensor values simultaneously and makes decisions based on **soil type, crop type and sensor data**

The LLM response is processed through a Markdown-to-Telegram-HTML converter before delivery:
 
* `**bold**` → `<b>bold</b>`
* `###` headings → bold text
* `*` bullets → `•` bullet points
* `---` dividers → `──────────────`
The formatted advisory is sent to the configured Telegram chat via the Bot API. Messages exceeding Telegram's 4,096-character limit are automatically truncated.

For Project purposes, the Messaging Part is implemented in Telegram for real case scenarios. The same system can be incorporated into SMS or WhatsApp-based messaging systems

### **4. OLED real-time display**
 
While the advisory is generated and delivered in the cloud, the OLED shows live sensor readings locally at the field node at all times — useful for in-field inspection without a phone.
 
Display layout:
```
KhetGPT
────────────────
Temp: 24.3 C
Press: 1012.4 hPa
Light: 1847
────────────────
```

### **5. Language configuration**
 
The advisory language is set in a single firmware constant:
 
```cpp
const char* Lang = "English";  // Change to "Malayalam", "Tamil", "Hindi", etc.
```
 
Gemini honours the language instruction and generates the full advisory in that language — no translation API needed.

## Usage Instructions
 
### Setting up the cloud server
 
**1. Clone the server and install dependencies:**
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NAVAJYOTH-KRISHNAN/myosa-khetgpt/tree/main/server
cd myosa-khetgpt/tree/main/server
npm install
```
 
**2. Set environment variables** (on Render, Railway, or locally via `.env`):
 
```plaintext
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
ESP_API_KEY=your_random_secret_key_minimum_32_chars
PORT=3000
```
 
**3. Start the server:**
 
```bash
npm start
```
 
The server will be live at `http://localhost:3000` or your Render deployment URL.

const char* ESP_API_KEY   = "your_secret_key_matching_server_env";
 
const char* Lang = "English";   // Advisory language
```
 
**3. Flash to ESP32** via Arduino IDE (board: ESP32 Dev Module, upload speed: 115200).
